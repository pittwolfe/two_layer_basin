# Introduction

This package contains two modules: `chebfun` and `two_layer_basin`.

# Modules

## chebfun

Routines for generating Chebyshev differentiation matrices, discrete Chebyshev transforms, interpolation, and integration.

## two_layer_basin

Defines the class `TwoLayerBasin`, which solves the linear steady-state baroclinic equations for a buoyancy-forced beta-plane basin. The model solves for the *residual* (i.e., thickness-weighted) velocities. In this formulation, eddy thickness fluxes appear as form drag in the momentum equations. The thickness diffusivity can be spatially variabile. Buoyancy forcing is implemented by relaxation to specified profile of interface depth with a spatially varying relaxation.

Solution is via Chebyshev colocation.
